### Hi there, I'm Thiago ðŸ‘‹

I have always liked to tinker with computers since a young age, but was always feeling a bit lost about where to go from it. For now, I've discovered Flutter and it changed the way I think about development.

But I also like to play with computer parts, linux distros, Android custom ROMs, hackintosh and getting to know what else a piece of technology can do besides of what it was supposed to do.
